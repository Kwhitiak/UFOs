# UFOs

## UFO sightings with Javascript, HTML, Bootstrap

# PRoject Overview

We will be using Javascript to perform in-depth analysis of UFO sightings around the US.  We will give users the ability to filter through multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, we will be adding table filters for city, state, country, and shape.
We have been tasked with helping one of out friend's, Dana, with building a webpage that has the ability to sort and filter through data of UFO sightings.

# UFO Sightings - The Truth is Out There

Upon entering, the visitor's "first encounter" will be met with the below homepage.  This page includes a brief intoduction along with a filter search results section and the data in table form.

### filtering 

We are able to filer through this data using the below filter search section.  This will allow us to view very specific data if necessary.

![Filter_search]("C:\Users\kwhit\Desktop\University of Dever Boot Camp\Module 11\UFOs\static\images\Filer_search.png")

![filtered_results_CA_Triangle]("C:\Users\kwhit\Desktop\University of Dever Boot Camp\Module 11\UFOs\static\images\filtered_results_CA_Triangle.png")

### Some things to note:



 - The search results are case sensitive and must not include too many "spaces".  The user must use the correct upper or lower case value to get the desired results.  Some of the data does not have the correct case values.
 - There are too many different types of shapes to make this search area useful.
 - data does not go beyond the year of 2010.
